LICENCE - add
Changes - update

boiler plate at top of each file
- extend to include description of file

add examples

complete test coverage

gphoto_timestamp_to_date should be configurable for format
 (and use locale?)

Base: make attributes per instance; allows User to have username and
      cli attributes.

Photo: keywords() should return string in scalar context, list of keywords
       in list context

Check everywhere for use of ref when blessed should be used

Investigate how confusing it would be to replace _set_photo/albu/user with _set_parent.

Documentation still needed for:
  PicasaWeb (to be completed)
  ClientLogin
  User
  Album
  Photo
  Comment
  Base

  TestServer.pmt???

Add DIAGOSTICS sections to POD describing error messages

Security - wipe passwords before destroying objects. Not great, but better
than nothing
